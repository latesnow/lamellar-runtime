/// The interface for performing remote bitwise operations on array elements
///
/// These operations can be performed using any [LamellarWriteArray] type
///
/// Both single element operations and batched element operations are provided
///
/// Generally if you are performing a large number of operations it will be better to
/// use a batched version instead of multiple single element opertations. While the
/// Runtime internally performs message aggregation for both single element and batched
/// operations, single element operates have to be treated as individual requests, resulting
/// in allocation and bookkeeping overheads. A single batched call on the other hand is treated
/// as a single request by the runtime. (See [ReadOnlyOps] for an example comparing single vs batched load operations of a list of indices)
///
/// The results of a batched operation are returned to the user in the same order as the input indices.
///
/// # One-sided Operation
/// performing either single or batched operations are both one-sided, with the calling PE performing any necessary work to
/// initate and execute active messages that are sent to remote PEs.
/// For Ops that return results, the result will only be available on the calling PE.
///
/// # Note
/// For both single index and batched operations there are no guarantees to the order in which individual operations occur (an individal operation is guaranteed to be atomic though).
///
/// # Batched Types
/// Three types of batched operations can be performed
/// ## One Value - Many Indicies
/// In this type, the same value will be applied to the provided indices
///```
/// use lamellar::array::prelude::*;
///
/// let world = LamellarWorldBuilder::new().build();
/// let array = AtomicArray::<usize>::new(&world,100,Distribution::Block);
///
/// let indices = vec![3,54,12,88,29,68];
/// let val = 0b100101001;
/// array.block_on(array.batch_fetch_bit_and(indices,val));
///```
/// ## Many Values - One Index
/// In this type, multiple values will be applied to the given index
///```
/// use lamellar::array::prelude::*;

/// let index = 10;
/// array.block_on(array.batch_bit_or(index,vals));
///```
/// ## Many Values - Many Indicies
/// In this type, values and indices have a one-to-one correspondance.
///
/// If the two lists are unequal in length, the longer of the two will be truncated so that it matches the length of the shorter
///```
